# Kingdomino-Game

This project is an implementation of the board game [Kingdomino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdomino) designed by Bruno Cathala and published by [Blue Orange Games](http://www.blueorangegames.com/).
It also includes multiple AI agents that follow a pre-determined strategy.

Note:
**This is not meant to be a complete playable game but a tool with just enough features to analyze the rule set, strategies and matchups !**

## The Goal

Be the player whose 5x5 kingdom earns them the highest number of points. Players earn points by strategically adding dominoes to their kingdoms, matching and connecting them to form different territories. Each domino has 2 terrain squares, and a territory is a group of matching terrain squares that are connected horizontally or vertically. The more connecting terrain squares and point-earning crowns a territory has, the more points players receive at the end of the game. 

## How To Play

* Use the **Mouse** to move tiles and navigate the menu.
* Hold **Left Click** to pick up a tile and release to place.
* Use the **Scroll Weel** to rotate the tile while holding it.
